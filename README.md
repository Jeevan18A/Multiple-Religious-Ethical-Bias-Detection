# Religious Bias Analysis in Large Language Models

## Overview

This project investigates religious bias in the responses generated by prominent Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Gemini (Bard), Mistral, and potentially GPT-4. By systematically evaluating model outputs to religiously sensitive prompts, we aim to identify and compare the presence of bias, including the reinforcement of stereotypes or harmful associations, versus the maintenance of neutrality.

## Key Objectives

1.  **Collect LLM Responses:** Utilize API calls to gather responses from various LLMs.
2.  **Bias Evaluation:** Analyze generated text for indicators of religious bias (e.g., stereotypes, negative connotations, preferential treatment).
3.  **Cross-Model Comparison:** Compare the levels and types of bias exhibited by different LLMs to understand their individual tendencies.
4.  **Data Storage:** Organize findings into structured datasets (e.g., CSV, JSON) for comprehensive analysis and future research.

## Significance

The increasing integration of LLMs in diverse applications like customer support, content creation, and decision-making underscores the critical importance of fairness and impartiality. Untreated bias in AI systems can lead to:

* **Reinforcement of Negative Stereotypes:** Perpetuating harmful and inaccurate perceptions of religious groups.
* **Influence on Public Perception and Misinformation:** Shaping opinions and potentially spreading biased information.
* **Erosion of Trust:** Undermining user confidence in AI technologies.

By meticulously identifying and quantifying bias trends, this project contributes to the advancement of AI fairness research, the promotion of ethical AI deployment, and the fostering of responsible AI development practices.

## Getting Started

[**Note:** Instructions on setting up API keys and the environment will be provided here.]

1.  **API Key Configuration:** Ensure you have correctly added your API keys for the target LLMs.
2.  **Environment Setup:** [Include instructions on installing necessary libraries (e.g., requests, pandas) and any other prerequisites.]
3.  **Running the Analysis:** [Provide clear instructions on how to execute the scripts for data collection and analysis.]
